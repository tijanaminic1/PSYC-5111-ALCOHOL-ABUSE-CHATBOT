This repository contains a final project for Psychology Seminar 2024 course held by Dr. Susan Nolan at Seton Hall University. The project outline was to identify a problem in your community and work with your team to propose a solution to the problem using psychological research. Our group chose to focus on campus alcohol abuse at Seton Hall University. The solution proposed was to make an interactive chatbot for students to use and discover more on and off-campous resources for alcohol abuse. The chatbot was designed and implemented by Tijana MiniÄ‡. Other contributors to the creative development of this app are Nicholas Caruso, Mari Nelson, and Inna Yatskiv.
